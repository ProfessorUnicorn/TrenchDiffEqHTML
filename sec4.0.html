<p class='noindent'>IN THIS CHAPTER we consider applications of first order differential equations.
</p><p class='noindent'><a href="sec4.1.book.html">SECTION 4.1</a> begins with a discussion of exponential growth and decay, which you have probably already seen
in calculus. We consider applications to radioactive decay, carbon dating, and compound interest. We also
consider more complicated problems where the rate of change of a quantity is in part proportional to the
magnitude of the quantity, but is also influenced by other other factors for example, a radioactive susbstance is
manufactured at a certain rate, but decays at a rate proportional to its mass, or a saver makes regular deposits in a
savings account that draws compound interest.
</p><p class='noindent'><a href="sec4.2.book.html">SECTION 4.2</a> deals with applications of Newton’s law of cooling and with mixing problems.
</p><p class='noindent'><a href="sec4.3.book.html">SECTION 4.3</a> discusses applications to elementary mechanics involving Newton’s second law of motion. The
problems considered include motion under the influence of gravity in a resistive medium, and determining the
initial velocity required to launch a satellite.
