			IN THIS CHAPTER we study a particularly important class of second order
			equations. Because of their many applications in science and engineering,
			second order differential equation have historically been the most
			thoroughly studied class of differential equations. Research on the theory
			of second order differential equations continues to the present day. This
			chapter is devoted to second order equations that can be written in the
			form \[ P_0(x)y''+P_1(x)y'+P_2(x)y=F(x)\] Such equations are said to be
			<span class="vocab">linear</span>
			. As in the case of first order linear equations, (A) is said to be
			<span class="vocab">homogeneous</span>
			if \(F\equiv 0\), or
			<span class="vocab">nonhomogeneous</span>
			if \(F\not \equiv 0\).
