<p class='noindent'>IN THIS CHAPTER we study a particularly important class of second order equations. Because of their many
applications in science and engineering, second order differential equation have historically been the most
thoroughly studied class of differential equations. Research on the theory of second order differential equations
continues to the present day. This chapter is devoted to second order equations that can be written in the
form
                                        \[ P_0(x)y''+P_1(x)y'+P_2(x)y=F(x)\]
 Such equations are said to be <span class='vocab'>linear</span>. As in the case of first order linear equations, (A) is said to be <span class='vocab'>homogeneous</span>
if \(F\equiv 0\), or <span class='vocab'>nonhomogeneous</span> if \(F\not \equiv 0\).
</p><p class='noindent'><a href="sec5.1.book.html">SECTION 5.1</a> is devoted to the theory of homogeneous linear equations.
</p><p class='noindent'><a href="sec5.2.book.html">SECTION 5.2</a> deals with homogeneous equations of the special form
                                                                                

                                                                                
                                        \[ ay''+by'+cy=0\]
 where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are constant (\(a\ne 0\)). When you’ve completed this section you’ll know everything there is to know about
solving such equations.
</p><p class='noindent'><a href="sec5.3.book.html">SECTION 5.3</a> presents the theory of nonhomogeneous linear equations.
</p><p class='noindent'>SECTIONS <a href="sec5.4.book.html">5.4</a> AND <a href="sec5.5.book.html">5.5</a> present the <span class='vocab'>method of undetermined coefficients</span>, which can be used to solve
nonhomogeneous equations of the form
                                        \[ ay''+by'+cy=F(x)\]
 where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are constants and \(F\) has a special form that is still sufficiently general to occur in many
applications. In this section we make extensive use of the idea of variation of parameters introduced in
Chapter 2.
</p><p class='noindent'><a href="sec5.6.book.html">SECTION 5.6</a> deals with <span class='vocab'>reduction of order</span>, a technique based on the idea of variation of parameters,
which enables us to find the general solution of a nonhomogeneous linear second order equation
provided that we know one nontrivial (not identically zero) solution of the associated homogeneous
equation.
