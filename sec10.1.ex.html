						Tanks \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) contain 50 gallons and 100 gallons of salt solutions, respectively. A solution with 2 pounds of salt per gallon is pumped into \(T_1\) from an external source at \(1\)&nbsp;gal/min, and a solution with \(3\) pounds of salt per gallon is pumped into \(T_2\) from an external source at \(2\)&nbsp;gal/min. The solution from \(T_1\) is pumped into \(T_2\) at \(3\) gal/min, and the solution from \(T_2\) is pumped into \(T_1\) at \(4\) gal/min. \(T_1\) is drained at \(2\)&nbsp;gal/min and \(T_2\) is drained at \(1\)&nbsp;gal/min. Let \(Q_1(t)\) and \(Q_2(t)\) be the number of pounds of salt in \(T_1\) and \(T_2\), respectively, at time \(t&gt;0\). Derive a system of differential equations for \(Q_1\) and \(Q_2\).

						Two 500 gallon tanks \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) initially contain 100 gallons each of salt solution. A solution with \(2\) pounds of salt per gallon is pumped into \(T_1\) from an external source at \(6\)&nbsp;gal/min, and a solution with \(1\) pound of salt per gallon is pumped into \(T_2\) from an external source at \(5\)&nbsp;gal/min. The solution from \(T_1\) is pumped into \(T_2\) at \(2\) gal/min, and the solution from \(T_2\) is pumped into \(T_1\) at \(1\) gal/min. Both tanks are drained at \(3\)&nbsp;gal/min.

				Nagle 5.1:
				Two large tanks, each holding 24 liters of a brine solution, are interconnected by pipes as shown in Figure 5.1. Fresh water flows into tank A at a rate of 6 L/min, and fluid is drained out of tank B at the same rate; also 8 L/min of fluid are pumped from tank A to tank B, and 2 L/min from tank B to tank A. The liquids inside each tank are kept well stirred so that each mixture is homogeneous. If, initially, the brine solution in tank A contains x0 kg of salt and that in tank B initially contains y0 kg of salt, determine the mass of salt in each tank at time

				Nagle 5.2#31:
				Two large tanks, each holding 100 L of liquid, are interconnected by pipes, with the liquid flowing from tank A into tank B at a rate of 3L/min and from B into A at a rate of 1 L/min (see Figure 5.2). The liq- uid inside each tank is kept well stirred. A brine solution with a concentration of 0.2 kg/L of salt flows into tank A at a rate of 6 L/min. The (diluted) solution flows out of the system from tank A at 4 L/min and from tank B at 2 L/min. If, initially, tank A contains pure water and tank B contains 20 kg of salt, determine the mass of salt in each tank at time t 􏰋 0.

				Nagle 7.6#59:
				The mixing tank in Figure 7.24 initially holds 500 L of a brine solution with a salt concentration of 0.2 kg/L. For the first 10 min of operation, valve A is open, adding 12 L/min of brine containing a 0.4 kg/L salt concentration. After 10 min, valve B is switched in, adding a 0.6 kg / L concentration at 12 L/min. The exit valve C removes 12 L/min, thereby keeping the volume constant. Find the concentration of salt in the tank as a function of time.
