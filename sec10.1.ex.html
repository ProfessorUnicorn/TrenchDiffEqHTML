				Tanks \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) contain 50 gallons and 100 gallons of salt solutions, respectively. A solution with 2 pounds of salt per gallon is pumped into \(T_1\) from an external source at \(1\)&nbsp;gal/min, and a solution with \(3\) pounds of salt per gallon is pumped into \(T_2\) from an external source at \(2\)&nbsp;gal/min. The solution from \(T_1\) is pumped into \(T_2\) at \(3\) gal/min, and the solution from \(T_2\) is pumped into \(T_1\) at \(4\) gal/min. \(T_1\) is drained at \(2\)&nbsp;gal/min and \(T_2\) is drained at \(1\)&nbsp;gal/min. Let \(Q_1(t)\) and \(Q_2(t)\) be the number of pounds of salt in \(T_1\) and \(T_2\), respectively, at time \(t&gt;0\). Derive a system of differential equations for \(Q_1\) and \(Q_2\). Assume that both mixtures are well stirred.

				Two 500 gallon tanks \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) initially contain 100 gallons each of salt solution. A solution with \(2\) pounds of salt per gallon is pumped into \(T_1\) from an external source at \(6\)&nbsp;gal/min, and a solution with \(1\) pound of salt per gallon is pumped into \(T_2\) from an external source at \(5\)&nbsp;gal/min. The solution from \(T_1\) is pumped into \(T_2\) at \(2\) gal/min, and the solution from \(T_2\) is pumped into \(T_1\) at \(1\) gal/min. Both tanks are drained at \(3\)&nbsp;gal/min. Let \(Q_1(t)\) and \(Q_2(t)\) be the number of pounds of salt in \(T_1\) and \(T_2\), respectively, at time \(t&gt;0\). Derive a system of differential equations for \(Q_1\) and \(Q_2\) that’s valid until a tank is about to overflow. Assume that both mixtures are well stirred.

				A mass \(m_1\) is suspended from a rigid support on a spring \(S_1\) with spring constant \(k_1\) and damping constant \(c_1\). A second mass \(m_2\) is suspended from the first on a spring \(S_2\) with spring constant \(k_2\) and damping constant \(c_2\), and a third mass \(m_3\) is suspended from the second on a spring \(S_3\) with spring constant \(k_3\) and damping constant \(c_3\). Let \(y_1=y_1(t)\), \(y_2=y_2(t)\), and \(y_3=y_3(t)\) be the displacements of the three masses from their equilibrium positions at time \(t\), measured positive upward. Derive a system of differential equations for \(y_1\), \(y_2\) and \(y_3\), assuming that the masses of the springs are negligible and that vertical external forces \(F_1\), \(F_2\), and \(F_3\) also act on the masses.

Derive a system of differential equations for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\), assuming that the object moves under Earth’s gravitational force (given by Newton’s law of gravitation, as in Example&nbsp;<span class="ptmb8t-">10.1.3</span>) and a resistive force proportional to the speed of the object. Let \(\alpha \) be the constant of proportionality.
