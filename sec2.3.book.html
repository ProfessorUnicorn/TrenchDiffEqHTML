				Although there are methods for solving some nonlinear equations, it’s
				impossible to find useful formulas for the solutions of most. Whether
				we’re looking for exact solutions or numerical approximations, it’s useful
				to know conditions that imply the existence and uniqueness of solutions of
				initial value problems for nonlinear equations. In this section we state
				such a condition and illustrate it with examples.

						If  \( f(x,y) \) is continuous on an open rectangle \( R:  \{ a < x < b, c < y < d \} \) that contains \( (x_0,y_0),\) then there exists at least one solution to the IVP <a href="#x1-5r1">(2.3.1)</a> on some open subinterval of \( (a,b) \) that contains \( x_0 \) but that solution may not be unique

					<li>
						If both \(f(x,y)\) the function and \(f_y(x,y)\) the partial derivative with respect to \(y\) are continuous on \(R\) then the IVP <a href="#x1-5r1">(2.3.1)</a> has a unique solution on some open subinterval of \((a,b)\) that contains \(x_0\) and the largest interval that has a unique solution must have continuity of both \(f(x,y)\) and \(f_y(x,y)\) on that interval

					more than one solution on a larger interval that contains
					\((a,b)\). For example, it may happen that \(b&lt;\infty \) and all

					that differ on every open interval that contains \(b\). Therefore \(f\)
					or \(f_y\) must have a discontinuity at some point in each open
					rectangle that contains \((b,\overline y)\), since if this were not so,
					<a href="#x1-7r2">(2.3.2)</a> would have a unique solution on some open interval that contains

							\end{equation*}
							
							This can only occur when the sum of squares is a negative value \( x^2 + y^2 = -1 \)
							and since all real numbers squared are positive, there are no real numbers that would make this true meaning \( f(x,y) \) is continuous for all points \( (x,y). \) Thus Theorem <a href="#x1-31">2.3.1.a</a> indicates that there exists at least one solution to the IVP <a href="#x1-9r3">(2.3.3)</a> on every open interval containing any \( x_0 \)

						<li>
							<div>
							Theorem <a href="#x1-31">2.3.1.a</a> guarantees that there exists a solution to the IVP so long as  \( f(x,y) \) is continuous on an open interval containing \( x_0 \) so we start by identifing \( f(x,y) \) and check what intervals it is continuous on.
							\begin{equation*}
								\frac{dy}{dx} = \overset{f(x,y)}{\overbrace{\frac{10}{3}xy^{\frac{2}{5}}}}
								\Longrightarrow
								f(x,y) = \frac{10}{3}x \sqrt[\overset{\text{odd}}{\overbrace{5}}]{y^{2}}
							\end{equation*}
							
							Since \( f(x,y) \) is a radical function with odd index there are no points of discontinuity meaning \( f(x,y) \) is continuous for all points \( (x,y). \) Thus Theorem <a href="#x1-31">2.3.1.a</a> indicates that there exists at least one solution to the IVP <a href="#x1-9r355eq238">(2.3.8)</a> on every open interval containing any \( x_0 \) the largest interval being \( (-\infty, \infty) \)
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<div>
							Now we know that a solution exists on every open interval, but we would like to know if that solution is unique. Theorem <a href="#x1-31">2.3.1.b</a> garantees the solution is unique as long as the function \( f(x,y) \) well as its partial derivative \( f_y(x,y) \) is continuous on the open interval containing thus we can find out by finding the partial derivative with respect to \( y \) using the power rule
						
							\begin{align*} 	
								f_y(x,y) = & \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left( \frac{10}{3}xy^{\frac{2}{5}} \right) \\
								= & \frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{10}{3} x y^{\frac{-3}{5}} \\
								= & \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{x}{\sqrt[3]{y^{2}}} \\ 
							\end{align*}

							The only possible points of discontinuity occur when the denominator equals zero:
							

							\begin{equation*}
								\sqrt[3]{y^{2}} = 0
							\end{equation*}
							
							This can only occur when \( y \) is zero which only happens for points on the \( x- \)axis meaning \( f_y(x,y) \) is continuous for all points \( (x,y) \) in all rectangles that do not include any part of the \( x- \)axis (any points where \( y = 0 \)). Thus Theorem <a href="#x1-31">2.3.1.b</a> indicates that there exists a unique solution to the IVP <a href="#x1-9r355eq238">(2.3.8)</a> on every open interval from any open rectangle that does not contain the \( x- \)axis. 
							</div>
							<div>
								Since \( f(x,y) \) was continuous everywhere, Theorem <a href="#x1-31">2.3.1.a</a> already indicated that there always exists a solution, meaning that open intervals that do not contain the \( x- \)axis will have unique solutions and open intervals that do  contain the \( x- \)axis will still have solutions but they won't be unique.

							<div>
							This IVP <a href = "#x1-22r9">(2.3.9)</a> is the same IVP as Example <a href="#x1-9r355">2.3.5</a> with \( x_0 = 0 \) and  \( y_0 = 0 \) and we already showed in that example that the IVP always has at least one solution everywhere on every open interval, and that the solution is unique whenever the open interval does not include the \(x-\)axis. Since the initial condition in this example is on the \(x-\)axis, this means the solution is not unique so we should be able to find two or more distinct solutions on every open interval containing \( x=0 \)
							</div>
							<div>	
								To show that the IVP <a href = "#x1-22r9">(2.3.9)</a> has two or more distinct solutions, we'll solve it. First notice the <span class="vocab">trivial solution</span> \( y(x) \equiv 0 \) satisfies the differential equation, which we can verify by substitution:
							
								<a id="x1-22r10"></a> 
							
								\begin{align} 	
									\frac{dy}{dx} = & {10 \over 3}xy^{\frac{2}{5}}  \\
									\frac{d}{dx} \Big( 0 \Big) = & {10 \over 3} x \Big(0\Big)^{\frac{2}{5}} \quad \checkmark \nonumber
								\end{align}

								And in fact, the trivial solution also satisfies the IVP <a href = "#x1-22r9">(2.3.9)</a> since it also satisfies the initial condition \( y(0) = 0 \) so we definitely know that there exists at least one solution, the trivial solution, which is defined  on every open interval containing \( x=0\) with IOV \((-\infty ,\infty )\)
							</div>
							<div>	
								Now we will investigate if there are other solutions by seeking nontrivial solutions where \( y \ne 0 \) allowing us to divide by \( y^{\frac{2}{5}} \) to separate the variables
	
								<a id="x1-22r11"></a>
								\begin{align} 	
									\frac{dy}{dx} = & {10 \over 3}xy^{\frac{2}{5}} \nonumber \\
									\frac{1}{y^{\frac{2}{5}}} \cdot \frac{dy}{dx} = & {10 \over 3}x \nonumber \\	
									\int \Big( \frac{1}{y^{\frac{2}{5}}}\frac{dy}{dx} \Big) dx = & \int \Big( {10 \over 3}x \Big) dx \nonumber \\
									\int y^{-\frac{2}{5}} dy = & {10 \over 3} \int x dx \nonumber \\
									\frac{5}{3} y^{\frac{3}{5}} = & {10 \over 3} \left(\frac{1}{2}x^2\right) + k \nonumber \\
									\frac{5}{3} y^{\frac{3}{5}} = & {5 \over 3} x^2  + k \nonumber \\
									y^{\frac{3}{5}} = & \frac{3}{5} \cdot {5 \over 3} x^2 + \underset{c}{\underbrace{ \frac{3}{5} k }} \nonumber \\
									y^{\frac{3}{5}} = & x^2 + c \nonumber \\
									y= & \left( x^2 + c \right)^{ \frac{5}{3} }
								\end{align}
	
								Now we have found the one-parameter family of functions <a href = "#x1-22r11">(2.3.11)</a> that is a solution of the differential equation <a href = "#x1-22r10">(2.3.10)</a> and we can verify <a href = "#x1-22r11">(2.3.11)</a> is a solution <a href = "#x1-22r10">(2.3.10)</a> by differentiating and substituting. We take note of the IOV for the solution based on the domain of <a href = "#x1-22r11">(2.3.11)</a> and since it is a radical with odd index, it is defined everywhere with IOV \((-\infty ,\infty )\) 
							</div>
							<div class="reading-exercise">

							</div> 
							
							<div>	
								In the case of this one-parameter family <a href = "#x1-22r11">(2.3.11)</a>, the trivial solution is not in the family since there is no choice for \( c \) that can yield the trivial solution therefore the trivial solution is a singular solution. Therefore the general solution of <a href = "#x1-22r10">(2.3.10)</a> consists of both a singlar solution (the trivial solution) and a one-paramter family:
				
								\begin {equation*} 
									y \equiv 0 
									\quad\quad 
									y = \left( x^2 + c \right)^{ \frac{5}{3} }
								\end {equation*}

								Now applying the initial conditon of the IVP <a href = "#x1-22r9">(2.3.9)</a> to the one-paramter family, we can solve for the constant \( c \)

								\begin {align*} 
									\underset{0}{\underbrace{y(0)}} = & \left( 0^2 + c \right)^{ \frac{5}{3} } \\
									0 = & c ^{ \frac{5}{3} } \Longrightarrow c = 0
								\end {align*}

								Substituting \( c = 0 \) we have a solution from the one-paramter family that also satisfies the IVP <a href = "#x1-22r9">(2.3.9)</a>

								\begin {align*} 
									y
									= & \left( x^2 + 0 \right)^{ \frac{5}{3} }
									=  \left( x^2 \right)^{ \frac{5}{3} }
									=  x^{ \frac{10}{3} }
								\end {align*}

								Now we have shown that there are two distinct solutions that satisfy the IVP <a href = "#x1-22r9">(2.3.9)</a>, the trivial solution and a solution from the one-parameter family, both of which are defined on every open interval containing \( x=0 \)

								\begin {equation*} 
									y \equiv 0 
									\quad\quad 
									y = x^{ \frac{10}{3} }
								\end {equation*}

								This agrees with Theorem <a href="#x1-31">2.3.1</a> since the rectangle contains the  
								\(x-\)axis in the case of this IVP, that the solution is not unique, and in fact, we were able to find two distinct solutions to the IVP both of which are defined on every open interval containing \( x=0 \) with IOV \((-\infty ,\infty )\)

							We already found two distinct solutions for the the IVP <a href="#x1-22r9">(2.3.9)</a>
							\begin {equation*} 
									y_1 \equiv 0 
									\quad\quad 
									y_2 = x^{ \frac{10}{3} }
							\end {equation*}

							Combining these we can create two additional distinct solutions using the piece-wise functions:

							\begin {equation*} 
								y_3 = 
								\left \{ 
									\begin {array}{cl} 
										0					&amp; x &lt; 0	\\

							<div>
							This IVP <a href = "#x1-27r12">(2.3.12)</a> is the same IVP as Example <a href="#x1-9r355">2.3.5</a> with \( x_0 = 0 \) and  \( y_0 = -1 \) and we already showed in that example that the IVP always has at least one solution everywhere on every open interval, and that the solution is unique whenever the open interval does not include the \(x-\)axis. Since the initial condition in this example is not on the \(x-\)axis (it is below the \(x-\)axis), this means the IVP has a unique solution on some open interval containing \( x=0 \) and we will find it.
							</div>
							<div>
								The IVP in Example <a href="#x1-216">2.3.6</a> has the same differential equation <a href = "#x1-22r10">(2.3.10)</a> and we already found the general solution includes both a singlar solution (the trivial solution) and a one-paramter family:
				
								\begin {equation*} 
									y \equiv 0 
									\quad\quad 
									y = \left( x^2 + c \right)^{ \frac{5}{3} }
								\end {equation*}

								Now applying the initial conditon of the IVP <a href = "#x1-27r12">(2.3.12)</a> to the one-paramter family, we can solve for the constant \( c \)

								\begin {align*}

								Notice that this solution has a domain of \((-\infty ,\infty )\) since it is a radical with odd index and thus the IOV for the IVP <a href = "#x1-27r12">(2.3.12)</a> is also \((-\infty ,\infty )\) 
							</div>
							<div>	
								However recall from Example <a href="#x1-9r355">2.3.5</a> that while the IVP always has a solution everywhere on every open interval, in order to find a unique solution we must limit our open rectangles only to those open intervals that do not include the \(x-\)axis. Since the initial condition in this example is not on the \(x-\)axis (it is below the \(x-\)axis), then we need to investigate whether our function ever intersects the \(x-\)axis, so we locate the \(x-\)intercepts by setting \( y = 0 \) on <a href="#x1-27r13">(2.3.13)</a> and solving for \( x \)

								\begin {align*} 
									0 = \left( x^2 - 1 \right)^{ \frac{5}{3} }

									0 = \left( x - 1 \right) \left( x + 1 \right) \\
									\Longrightarrow &
									x = 1 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
								\end {align*}

								This means that the solution <a href="#x1-27r13">(2.3.13)</a> intersects the \(x-\)axis at  \( x = 1 \) and  \( x = -1 \) so the largest open interval containing our initial \(x\) value \( x = 0 \) is the open interval  \( (-1,1) \) which is the largest open interval where the IVP <a href = "#x1-27r12">(2.3.12)</a> has the unique solution <a href="#x1-27r13">(2.3.13)</a> meaning any larger open intervals will still have a solution but they will not be unique.

							<div>
								Since the solution intersects the \( y-\)axis at  \( x = 1 \) and  \( x = -1 \) then any open interval containing either of those points will have multiple solutions to the IVP. Since we are considering the open interval \((-\infty ,\infty )\) then we know that there will be multiple solutions, so we will call \( y_1 = \left( x^2 -1 \right)^{ \frac{5}{3} } \)
								and then just like we did in Example <a href="#x1-216">2.3.6</a> we can combine this solution on the interval \( (-1,1) \) with other solutions from the general solution to create additional distinct solutions using piece-wise functions.

					<summary>Solution</summary>

					<div>
						This IVP <a href = "#x1-27r14">(2.3.14)</a> is the same IVP as Example <a href="#x1-9r355">2.3.5</a> with \( x_0 = 0 \) and  \( y_0 = 1 \) and we already showed in that example that the IVP always has at least one solution everywhere on every open interval, and that the solution is unique whenever the open interval does not include the \(x-\)axis. Since the initial condition in this example is not on the \(x-\)axis (it is above the \(x-\)axis), this means the IVP has a unique solution on some open interval containing \( x=0 \) and we will find it.
							<div>
								The IVP in Example <a href="#x1-216">2.3.6</a> has the same differential equation <a href = "#x1-22r10">(2.3.10)</a> and we already found the general solution includes both a singlar solution (the trivial solution) and a one-paramter family:
				
								\begin {equation*} 
									y(x) \equiv 0 
									\quad\quad 
									y(x) = \left( x^2 + c \right)^{ \frac{5}{3} }
								\end {equation*}

								Now applying the initial conditon of the IVP <a href = "#x1-27r14">(2.3.14)</a> to the one-paramter family, we can solve for the constant \( c \)

								\begin {align*} 
									\underset{1}{\underbrace{y(0)}} = & \left( 0^2 + c \right)^{ \frac{5}{3} } \\
									1 = & c ^{ \frac{5}{3} } \Longrightarrow c = 1
								\end {align*}

								Substituting \( c = 1 \) we have a solution from the one-paramter family that satisfies the IVP <a href = "#x1-27r14">(2.3.14)</a>

								<a id="x1-27r15"></a>
								\begin {align} 
									y(x)
									= & \left( x^2 + 1 \right)^{ \frac{5}{3} }
								\end {align}

								We take note of the IOV for the solution based on the domain and since it is a radical with odd index, it is defined everywhere with IOV \((-\infty ,\infty )\) 
							</div>
							<div>	
								Now recall from Example <a href="#x1-9r355">2.3.5</a> that while the IVP always has at least one solution everywhere on every open interval, in order to find a unique solution we must limit our open rectangles only to those open intervals that do not include the \(x-\)axis. Since the initial condition in this example is not on the \(x-\)axis (it is above the \(x-\)axis), then we need to investigate whether our function ever intersects the \(x-\)axis, so we locate the \(x-\)intercepts by setting \( y = 0 \) on <a href="#x1-27r13">(2.3.13)</a> and solving for \( x \)

								\begin {align*} 
									0 = \left( x^2 + 1 \right)^{ \frac{5}{3} }
									\Longrightarrow &
									0 = x^2 + 1  \\
									\Longrightarrow &
									x = \pm i  \\
								\end {align*}

								This means that the solution <a href="#x1-27r15">(2.3.15)</a> has no \(x-\)intercepts and never intersects the \(x-\)axis meaning the largest open interval would be \( (-\infty,\infty) \) and <a href="#x1-27r13">(2.3.13)</a> is the unique solution shown in Figure <a href="#-the-unique-solution-of-eq-">2.3.4</a>.
