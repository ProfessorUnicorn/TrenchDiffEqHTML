				Suppose an object with initial temperature \(T_0\) is placed in a

				In our previous examples and exercises concerning Newton’s law of
				cooling we assumed that the temperature of the medium remains
				constant. This model is adequate if the heat lost or gained by the
				object is insignificant compared to the heat required to cause an
				appreciable change in the temperature of the medium. If this isn’t so,
				we must use a model that accounts for the heat exchanged between the
				object and the medium. Let \(T=T(t)\) and \(A=A(t)\) be the
				temperatures of the object and the medium, respectively, and let
				\(T_0\) and \(A_{0}\) be their initial values. Again, we assume that
				\(T\) and \(A\) are related by Newton’s law of cooling, \[
				\dot{T}=-k(T-A). {\tag A} \] We also assume that the change in heat
				of the object as its temperature changes from \(T_0\) to \(T\) is
				\(a(T-T_0)\) and that the change in heat of the medium as its
				temperature changes from \(A_{0}\) to \(A\) is \(a(A-A_{0})\),
				where \(a\) and \(\tau\) are positive constants depending upon the
				masses and thermal properties of the object and medium, respectively.
				If we assume that the total heat of the system consisting of the
				object and the medium remains constant (that is, energy is conserved),
				then \[ b(T-T_0)+a(A-A_{0})=0. {\tag B} \]
