			<a href="sec2.1.book.html">SECTION&nbsp;2.1</a>
			deals with linear equations, the simplest kind of first order equations.
			In this section we introduce the method of variation of parameters. The
			idea underlying this method will be a unifying theme for our approach to
			solving many different kinds of differential equations throughout the
			book.

			<a href="sec2.2.book.html">SECTION&nbsp;2.2</a>
			deals with separable equations, the simplest nonlinear equations. In this
			section we introduce the idea of implicit and constant solutions of
			differential equations, and we point out some differences between the
			properties of linear and nonlinear equations.

			discusses existence and uniqueness of solutions of nonlinear equations.
			Although it may seem logical to place this section before
			Section&nbsp;2.2, we presented Section&nbsp;2.2 first so we could have
			illustrative examples in Section&nbsp;2.3.
