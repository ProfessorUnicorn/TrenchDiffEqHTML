<p class='noindent'>IN THIS CHAPTER we study first order equations for which there are general methods of solution.
</p><p class='noindent'><a href="sec2.1.book.html">SECTION 2.1</a> deals with linear equations, the simplest kind of first order equations. In this section we
introduce the method of variation of parameters. The idea underlying this method will be a unifying
theme for our approach to solving many different kinds of differential equations throughout the
book.
</p><p class='noindent'><a href="sec2.2.book.html">SECTION 2.2</a> deals with separable equations, the simplest nonlinear equations. In this section we introduce the
idea of implicit and constant solutions of differential equations, and we point out some differences between the
properties of linear and nonlinear equations.
</p><p class='noindent'><a href="sec2.3.book.html">SECTION 2.3</a> discusses existence and uniqueness of solutions of nonlinear equations. Although it may seem
logical to place this section before Section 2.2, we presented Section 2.2 first so we could have illustrative
examples in Section 2.3.
</p><p class='noindent'><a href="sec2.4.book.html">SECTION 2.4</a> deals with nonlinear equations that are not separable, but can be transformed into separable
equations by a procedure similar to variation of parameters.
</p><p class='noindent'><a href="sec2.5.book.html">SECTION 2.5</a> covers exact differential equations, which are given this name because the method for solving
them uses the idea of an exact differential from calculus.
</p><p class='noindent'><a href="sec2.6.book.html">SECTION 2.6</a> deals with equations that are not exact, but can made exact by multiplying them by a function
known called <span class='vocab'>integrating factor</span>.
