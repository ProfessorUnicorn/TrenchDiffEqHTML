</p><p class='indent'>
</p><p class='noindent'>Suppose we deposit an amount of money \(Q_0\) in an interest-bearing account and make no further deposits or
withdrawals for \(t\) years, during which the account bears interest at a constant annual rate \(r\). To calculate the value of
the account at the end of \(t\) years, we need one more piece of information: how the interest is added to the account,
or—as the bankers say—how it is <span class='vocab'>compounded</span>. If the interest is compounded annually, the value of the
account is multiplied by \(1+r\) at the end of each year. This means that after \(t\) years the value of the account
is
                                                                                

                                                                                
                                        \[ Q(t)=Q_0(1+r)^t\]
 If interest is compounded semiannually, the value of the account is multiplied by \((1+r/2)\) every 6 months. Since this
occurs twice annually, the value of the account after \(t\) years is
                                        \[ Q(t)=Q_0\left (1+{r\over 2}\right )^{2t}\]
 In general, if interest is compounded \(n\) times per year, the value of the account is multiplied \(n\) times per year by \((1+r/n)\);
therefore, the value of the account after \(t\) years is \begin {equation}  \label {eq:4.1.8} Q(t)=Q_0\left (1+{r\over n}\right )^{nt}\end {equation}<a id='x1-14r8'></a> Thus, increasing the frequency of compounding increases

 The rate of increase is the constant \(a\). Since \(Q\) is radioactive with decay constant \(k\), the rate of decrease is \(kQ\).
Therefore
                                                                                

                                                                                
                                        \[ Q'=a-kQ\]
 This is a linear first order differential equation. Rewriting it and imposing the initial condition shows that \(Q\) is the
solution of the initial value problem \begin {equation}  \label {eq:4.1.11} Q'+kQ=a, \quad Q(0)=Q_0\end {equation}<a id='x1-23r11'></a> Since \(e^{-kt}\) is a solution of the complementary equation, the solutions of (<a href='#x1-23r11'>4.1.11<!-- tex4ht:ref: eq:4.1.11  --></a>)
are of the form \(Q=ue^{-kt}\), where \(u'e^{-kt}=a\), so \(u'=ae^{kt}\). Hence,
                                        \[ u={a\over k}e^{kt}+c \]
 and
                                        \[ Q=ue^{-kt}={a\over k}+ce^{-kt}\]
 Since \(Q(0)=Q_0\), setting \(t=0\) here yields
                                        \[ Q_0={a\over k}+c \mbox {\quad or \quad } c=Q_0-{a\over k}\]

<p class='noindent'><span id='textcolor5'>Carbon Dating</span>
</p><p class='indent'>
</p><p class='noindent'>The fact that \(Q\) approaches a steady state value in the situation discussed in Example 4 underlies the method of
<span class='vocab'>carbon dating</span>, devised by the American chemist and Nobel Prize Winner W.S. Libby.
</p><p class='indent'>  Carbon 12 is stable, but carbon-14, which is produced by cosmic bombardment of nitrogen in the upper
atmosphere, is radioactive with a half-life of about 5570 years. Libby assumed that the quantity of
carbon-12 in the atmosphere has been constant throughout time, and that the quantity of radioactive
carbon-14 achieved its steady state value long ago as a result of its creation and decomposition over
millions of years. These assumptions led Libby to conclude that the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12
has been nearly constant for a long time. This constant, which we denote by \(R\), has been determined
experimentally.
</p><p class='indent'>  Living cells absorb both carbon-12 and carbon-14 in the proportion in which they are present in the
environment. Therefore the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in a living cell is always \(R\). However, when the cell
dies it ceases to absorb carbon, and the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 decreases exponentially as the
radioactive carbon-14 decays. This is the basis for the method of carbon dating, as illustrated in the next
example.

<p class='indent'>
</p><p class='noindent'><span class='ptmb8t-'>Solution </span> Let \(Q=Q(t)\) be the quantity of carbon-14 in an individual set of remains \(t\) years after death, and let \(Q_0\) be the
quantity that would be present in live individuals. Since carbon-14 decays exponentially with half-life 5570 years,
its decay constant is
                                        \[ k={\ln 2\over 5570}\]
 Therefore
                                                                                

                                                                                
                                        \[ Q=Q_0e^{-t(\ln 2)/5570} \]
 if we choose our time scale so that \(t_0=0\) is the time of death. If we know the present value of \(Q\) we can solve this
equation for \(t\), the number of years since death occurred. This yields
                                        \[ t=-5570 {\ln Q/Q_0\over \ln 2}\]
 It is given that \(Q=.42Q_0\) in the remains of individuals who died first. Therefore these deaths occurred about
                                        \[ t_1=-5570 {\ln .42\over \ln 2} \approx 6971 \]

for about 400 years.

that the deposits are made continuously at a rate of $2600 per year. This is essential, since solutions of

                                        \[ Q'=2600+.06 Q \]
