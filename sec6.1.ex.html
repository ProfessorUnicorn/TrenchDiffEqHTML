				Use Hooke's Law \(mg=k\Delta l\) to set up the equation of motion \(m\ddot{y} + c\dot{y} + ky = 0 \) to model the displacement assuming that there’s no damping. Then set up an IVP to model the specific initial conditions. Find both the general solution and the particular solution to the IVP. Find the frequency, period, amplitude, and phase angle and then write amplitude-phase form of the solution. Finally graph both on one axis (they should match)
