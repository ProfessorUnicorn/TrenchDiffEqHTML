      In order to apply mathematical methods to a physical or “real life” problem, we must formulate the problem in mathematical terms; that is, we must construct a <span class="vocab">mathematical model</span> for the problem. Many physical problems concern relationships between changing quantities. Since <span class="vocab">rates of change</span> are represented mathematically by <span class="vocab">derivatives</span>, mathematical models often involve equations relating an unknown function and one or more of its derivatives. Such equations are <span class="vocab">differential equations</span>.

      The mathematical model for an applied problem is almost always simpler than the actual situation
      being studied, since simplifying assumptions are usually required to obtain a mathematical problem that can be solved. For example, in modeling the motion of a falling object, we might neglect air resistance and the gravitational pull of celestial bodies other than Earth, or in modeling population growth we might assume that the population grows continuously rather than in discrete steps.

      <span class="vocab">Differential notation</span> (<span class="vocab">Leibniz notation</span>) clearly identifies the variable we are differentiating with respect to and thus is the preferred and primary notation we will be using.

    <summary>Population Growth and Decay</summary>
  
    <div id="f99bfd76-6e95-4b26-84df-801a682c781b">
      Although the number of members of a population (people in a given country, bacteria in a laboratory culture,
      wildflowers in a forest, etc.) at any given time \(t\) is a discrete value and must be an integer (<em>you cannot have half of a person</em>), models that use differential equations to describe the growth and decay of populations usually rest on the simplifying assumption that the number of members of the population can be regarded as a continuous differentiable function \(P=P(t)\) of time. In most models it is assumed that the differential equation takes the form 
      <a id="x1-2r1"></a>
      \begin {equation} \label {eq:1.1.1} 
        \dot{P}=a(P)P(t)
      \end {equation}
      where \(a=a(P)\) is a continuous function of \(P\) that represents the rate of
      change of population per unit time per individual. In the <span class="vocab">Malthusian model</span>, it
      is assumed that \(a(P)\) is a constant, so (<a href="#x1-2r1">1.1.1</a>) becomes 
      <a id="x1-3r2"></a> 
      \begin {equation} \label {eq:1.1.2}
        \dot{P}=aP
      \end {equation}
      This model assumes that the numbers of births and deaths per unit time are both proportional to the population. The constants of proportionality are the <span class="vocab">birth rate</span>
      (births per unit time per individual) and the <span class="vocab">death rate</span> (deaths per unit time per individual) and \(a\) is the birth rate minus the death rate.

      From calculus, recall a function whose derivative is proportional to the original function as in <a href="#x1-3r2">(1.1.2)</a>. Ignoring the constant or proportionality, what function is actually equal to its derivative?
      \[\dot{P} = P\]
      Of course, exponential functions! \(\displaystyle \frac{d}{dt} \Big( e^t \Big) = e^t\) and including the proportionality constant \(a\), the function \(P(t) = e^{at}\) satisfies <a href="#x1-3r2">(1.1.2)</a>.

      In fact, the function still satisfies (<a href="#x1-3r2">1.1.2</a>) when we include an <span class="vocab">arbitrary constant</span> factor

      The Malthusian model <a href="#x1-3r2">(1.1.2)</a> is used to model population growth and states that a population’s rate of growth is proportional to its initial population. Taking the initial population at time \( t = 0 \) to be \( P(0) = P_0 \) as the <span class="vocab">initial condition</span>, we can solve for the constant \(c \) to obtain a <span class="vocab">particular solution</span>

      \[ P=P_0e^{at}\]

    <div id="9a0b21cb-96de-4191-b2e6-bb2730b90afc">
      While \( P=P_0e^{at} \) is the solution to the Malthusian model <a href="#x1-3r2">(1.1.2)</a> with initial population \( P_0 \), it is only a mathematical model and it cannot model a real-life situation perfectly forever. For instance, whenever the birth rate minus the death rate is a positive value \( a \), then the function grows exponentially forever:
        
        \begin{align*}
            \lim_{t \to \infty}P
            & =\lim_{t \to \infty}P_0e^{at} \\
            & =P_0\lim_{t \to \infty}e^{at} \\
            & =P_0 e^{\infty} \\
            & =\infty
        \end{align*}

      But there are other variables that limit a population's growth that are not being accounted for. This model only models the population growth accurately for range of time when the resources of the population needed to reproduce (food, water, air, shelter, etc.) are effectively infinite.

    <div class="reading-exercise" id="66fc7339-e552-443b-8120-5717fb4f4d99">

      In general populations do not have infinite resources. This flaw in the Malthusian model suggests the need for a model that accounts for limitations of space and resources that tend to oppose the rate of population growth as the population increases. Perhaps the most famous model of this kind is the <span class="vocab">Verhulst model</span>, where <a href="#x1-3r2">(1.1.2)</a> is replaced by 
      
      <a id="x1-5r4"></a>
      
      \begin {equation} \label {eq:1.1.4} 
        \dot{P}=aP(1-\alpha P)
      \end {equation} 

      where \(\alpha\) is a positive constant and the ratio of the rate of change of the population to the population itself, \( \dot{P}/P \) is approximately \( a \) making this model approximately exponential. 
      As the population grows larger, the rate of change of population will decrease, which accounts for the depleting resources of a growing population.

        Previously we assumed that the temperature of the surroundings remains constant. This is reasonable in some situations such as a cup of hot coffee cooling down in a room, since, for one thing, the coffee cools down relatively quickly (in a few minutes) and also the cup of coffee is relatively small compared to the room, so the heat emitted by the cooling coffee does not heat up the room much. But, can you think of other situations where this model would not not apply? 
      </p> 
      <p> 
        For instance, what if the time it takes an object to cool down is measured in much larger time intervals, say it takes days to cool the object down. Now if you placed the object outside during summer, and it takes several days to cool down, is it reasonable to assume the temperature of the surroundings would remain constant throughout that entire time? Or would the temperature vary? It would likely be cooler at night and warmer in the day, right? 
      </p> 
      <p>
        Or what if the object is extremely hot and relatively large compared to the surroundings? For instance, what if you boiled a large pot of soup and place it directly into the refrigerator in your kitchen. The temperature of the surroundings inside the fridge is quite cold, but the pot of boiling soup is emitting heat and heating up the fridge. If you did this at home and opened your fridge after a few minutes, you would find that the fridge has warmed up a little from the temperature of the boiled soup. These are just a couple of examples where we can imagine the temperature of the surroundings not to remain constant.

      Let's consider a model that accounts for the heat exchanged between the object and the surroundings, such as the soup in the fridge. Let \( T=T(t) \) be the temperature of the object and let \( A=A(t) \) the temperature of the surroundings continuous changing functions. Let \( T(0)=T_0 \) be the initial temperature of the object and let \( A(0)=A_0 \) be the initial temperature of the surroundings. Again, we assume that \( T(t) \) and \( A(t) \) are related by Newton's law of cooling (<a href="#x1-7r5">1.1.5</a>) which states that the temperature of the object changes at a rate proportional to the difference between the temperature of the object and the temperature of the surroundings

      \begin{equation*}
        \dot{T} = -k\Big(T(t)-A(t)\Big)
      \end{equation*}

      Now let's assume that the change in heat of the object as its temperature changes from \( T_0 \) to \( T \) is \( \tau (T-T_0) \) where \( \tau \) is some positive constant. And we'll assume that the change in heat of the surroundings as its temperature changes from \( A_0 \) to \( A \) is \( a(A-A_0) \) where \( a \) is some positive constant. The positive constants \( \tau \) and \( a \) are dependent on the physical properties of the object and the medium and must be determined experimentally in the lab.
      <p>
        Assuming the <span class="vocab">conservation of energy</span>, that is, the total heat between the object and the surroundings remains constant, then these two values would add to zero:

        \begin{equation*}
          \tau(T-T_0) + a(A-A_0) = 0

        Solving this equation for \( A \), we obtain an expression for a function that models the temperature of the surroundings

        \begin{equation*}
          A = -\frac{\tau}{a}(T-T_0) + A_0
        \end{equation*}

        </div>  

      Substituting this into Newton's Law of Cooling (<a href="#x1-7r5">1.1.5</a>) and simplifying results in the differential equation for the temperature of the object:

    <div id="68ca6fa0-3821-4259-9e43-a8a938584160">One model for the spread of epidemics assumes that the number of people infected changes at a rate
      proportional
      to the product of the number of people already infected and the number of people who are susceptible, but not yet
      infected. Therefore, if \(S\) denotes the total population of susceptible people and \(I=I(t)\) denotes the number
      of infected people at time \(t\), then \(S-I\) is the number of people who are susceptible, but not yet infected.
      Thus,
      \[ I'=rI(S-I)\]

      According to <span class="vocab">Newton’s second law of motion</span>, the instantaneous acceleration \(a\) of an object with constant mass \(m\) is related to the force \(F\) acting on the object by the equation 
      \[F=ma\] 
      Recall that acceleration is the first derivative of velocity, so Newton’s 2nd law could be written as a first order differential equation with velocity \( v \) as the dependent variable
      \[F=m \dot{v} \]

      We'll assume the motion of the object is along a vertical line on the \(y-\)axis. For instance, suppose you are tossing a ball directly upward and \(y(t)\) represent the position of the ball measured positive upward. Recall that velocity is the first derivative of position and acceleration is the second derivative of position, so Newton’s 2nd law could be written as a second order differential equation with position \( y \) as the dependent variable

      For simplicity, we'll assume that the mass is one, \(m=1\), and the differential equation further simplifies:

    <div class="indent" id="8724d562-f8e9-47f2-93f2-916e7d5b3942">
      To further develop the differential equation portraying Newton’s 2nd law, we will want to expand upon what the forces \( F \) could be. In general there are 3 types of forces that may act on the object:
      <ol id="ad6a72e1-7485-434a-b36b-d9f2ee6a65fc">
        <li>
          A force such as <span class="vocab">gravity</span> that depends only on the position \(y(t)\), which we write as a function of \(y\) written as \(-p(y)\), where \(p(y)&gt;0\) if \(y\ge 0\)
        </li>  
        <li> 
          A force such as <span class="vocab">air resistance</span> that depends on the position \(y(t)\) and velocity  \(v(t)\) of the object, which we write as \(-q \left( y, \dot{y} \right) \dot{y} \) where \( q \ge 0 \) and we have one \( \dot{y} \) factored out to indicate that the resistive force is always in the direction opposite to the velocity 
        </li>  
        <li> 
          Any <span class="vocab">external force</span> \(f=f(t)\) that is separate from the object and depends only on time \(t\) (such as a towline from a helicopter)
        </li>  
      </ol> 
        Thus the 3 possible forces are \( -p(y) \), \( q(y, \dot{y})\dot{y} \), and \( f(t) \), and thus the total force is given as the sum of all three
        
        \begin{equation*}
            F = -p(y) + q\left(y,\dot{y}\right)\dot{y} + f(t)
