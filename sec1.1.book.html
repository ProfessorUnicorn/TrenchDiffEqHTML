    <summary>Mathematical Models</summary>

    <p class='noindent'>In order to apply mathematical methods to a physical or “real life” problem, we must formulate the
      problem in mathematical terms; that is, we must construct a <span class='vocab'>mathematical model</span> for the problem.
      Many physical problems concern relationships between changing quantities. Since <span class='vocab'>rates of change</span> are represented
      mathematically by <span class='vocab'>derivatives</span>, mathematical models often involve equations relating an unknown function and one
      or more of its derivatives. Such equations are <span class='vocab'>differential equations</span>. They are the
      subject of this book.
    </p>
    <p class='indent'> Much of calculus is devoted to learning mathematical techniques that are applied in later courses
      in
      mathematics and the sciences; you wouldn’t have time to learn much calculus if you insisted on
      seeing a specific application of every topic covered in the course. Similarly, much of this book is
      devoted to methods that can be applied in later courses. Only a relatively small part of the book is
      devoted to the derivation of specific differential equations from mathematical models, or relating the
      differential equations that we study to specific applications. In this section we mention a few such
      applications.
    </p>
    <p class='indent'> The mathematical model for an applied problem is almost always simpler than the actual situation
      being
      studied, since simplifying assumptions are usually required to obtain a mathematical problem that can be solved.
      For example, in modeling the motion of a falling object, we might neglect air resistance and the gravitational pull
      of celestial bodies other than Earth, or in modeling population growth we might assume that the population grows
      continuously rather than in discrete steps.
    </p>
    <p class='indent'> A good mathematical model has two important properties:
    </p>
    <ul class='itemize1'>
      <li class='itemize'>It’s sufficiently simple so that the mathematical problem can be solved.
      </li>
      <li class='itemize'>It represents the actual situation sufficiently well so that the solution to the mathematical
        problem
        predicts the outcome of the real problem to within a useful degree of accuracy. If results predicted
        by the model don’t agree with physical observations, the underlying assumptions of the model must
        be revised until satisfactory agreement is obtained.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class='indent'> We’ll now give examples of mathematical models involving differential equations. We’ll return to
      these
      problems at the appropriate times, as we learn how to solve the various types of differential equations that occur
      in the models.
    </p>

  <details>
    <summary>Derivative Notation</summary>

    <p class='indent'> All the examples in this section deal with functions of time, which we denote by \(t\). If \(y\) is
      a function of \(t\), \(\dot{y}\) denotes
      the derivative of \(y\) with respect to \(t\); thus,
      \[ \dot{y}={dy\over dt} \]
    </p>

    <summary>Population Growth and Decay</summary>
  
    <p class='noindent'>Although the number of members of a population (people in a given country, bacteria in a
      laboratory culture,
      wildflowers in a forest, etc.) at any given time \(t\) is necessarily an integer, models that use differential
      equations to
      describe the growth and decay of populations usually rest on the simplifying assumption that the number of
      members of the population can be regarded as a differentiable function \(P=P(t)\). In most models it is assumed that the differential equation takes the form \begin {equation} \label {eq:1.1.1} \dot{P}=a(P)P(t)\end {equation}<a
        id='x1-2r1'></a> where \(a\) is a continuous function of \(P\) that represents the rate of
      change of population per unit time per individual. In the <span class='vocab'>Malthusian model</span>, it
      is assumed that \(a(P)\) is a
      constant, so (<a href='#x1-2r1'>1.1.1<!-- tex4ht:ref: eq:1.1.1  --></a>) becomes \begin {equation} \label {eq:1.1.2}
      \dot{P}=aP\end {equation}<a id='x1-3r2'></a> (When you see a name in blue italics, just click on it for information
      about the person.) This model assumes that the numbers of births and deaths per unit time are both
      proportional to the population. The constants of proportionality are the <span class='vocab'>birth rate</span>
      (births per unit
      time per individual) and the <span class='vocab'>death rate</span> (deaths per unit time per individual); \(a\)
      is the birth rate minus
      the death rate. From calculus, we know if \(c\) is any <span class='vocab'>arbitrary constant</span> then \begin {equation} \label {eq:1.1.3}
      P=ce^{at} \end {equation}<a id='x1-4r3'></a> satisfies (<a href='#x1-3r2'>1.1.2<!-- tex4ht:ref: eq:1.1.2  --></a>),
      so (<a href='#x1-3r2'>1.1.2<!-- tex4ht:ref: eq:1.1.2  --></a>) has
      infinitely many solutions represented by different values for \(c\). We call this our <span class='vocab'>general solution</span>.
      To select the solution of the specific problem that we’re considering, we must
      know the population \(P_0\) at an initial time, say \(t=0\). Setting \(t=0\) in (<a
        href='#x1-4r3'>1.1.3<!-- tex4ht:ref: eq:1.1.3  --></a>) yields \(c=P(0)=P_0\), so the applicable solution
      is \[ P(t)=P_0e^{at}\]
      This implies that
      \[ \lim _{t\to \infty }P(t)=\left \{\begin {array}{cl}\infty&amp; \mbox { if }a&gt;0\\ 0&amp;\mbox { if }a&lt;0
      \end {array}\right. \]
      that is, the population approaches infinity if the birth rate exceeds the death rate, or zero if the death rate
      exceeds the birth rate.
    </p>
    <p class="reading-exercise">
      For \(a &lt; 0\), use the limit laws to show the \(\lim _{t\to \infty }P(t)= 0 \)
    </p>
    <p class="reading-exercise">
      For \(a &gt; 0\), use the limit laws to show the \(\lim _{t\to \infty }P(t)= \infty \)
    </p>
    <p class='indent'> To see the limitations of the Malthusian model, suppose we’re modeling the population of a country,
      starting from a time \(t=0\) when the birth rate exceeds the death rate (so \(a&gt;0\)), and the country’s resources in terms
      of space, food supply, and other necessities of life can support the existing population. Then the prediction \(P=P_0e^{at}\) may
      be reasonably accurate as long as it remains within limits that the country’s resources can support. However, the model must
      inevitably lose validity when the prediction exceeds these limits. (If nothing else, eventually there won’t be
      enough space for the predicted population!)
    </p>
    <p class='indent'> This flaw in the Malthusian model suggests the need for a model that accounts for limitations of
      space and
      resources that tend to oppose the rate of population growth as the population increases. Perhaps the most famous
      model of this kind is the <span
          class='vocab'>Verhulst model</span>, where (<a href='#x1-3r2'>1.1.2<!-- tex4ht:ref: eq:1.1.2  --></a>) is
      replaced by \begin {equation} \label {eq:1.1.4} \dot{P}=aP(1-\alpha P)\end {equation}<a id='x1-5r4'></a> where \(\alpha
      \) is a positive constant.
      As long as \(P\) is small compared to \(1/\alpha \), the ratio \(\dot{P}/P\) is approximately equal to \(a\). Therefore
      the growth is
      approximately exponential; however, as \(P\) increases, the ratio \(\dot{P}/P\) decreases as opposing factors become
      significant.
    </p>
    <p class='indent'> Equation (<a href='#x1-5r4'>1.1.4<!-- tex4ht:ref: eq:1.1.4  --></a>) is the <span
        class='vocab'>logistic equation</span>. You will learn how to solve it in Section 1.2. (See Exercise 2.2.<span
        class='ptmb8t-'>28</span>.)
      The solution is
      \[ P={P_0\over \alpha P_0+(1-\alpha P_0)e^{-at}}\]
      where \(P_0=P(0)&gt;0\). Therefore \(\lim _{t\to \infty }P(t)=1/\alpha \), independent of \(P_0\).

    <summary>Newton’s Law of Cooling</summary>

    <p class='noindent'>According to <span class='vocab'>Newton’s law of cooling</span>, the temperature of a body changes at a rate proportional to
      the difference
      between the temperature of the body and the temperature of the surrounding medium. Thus, if \(T_m\) is the
      temperature
      of the medium and \(T=T(t)\) is the temperature of the body at time \(t\), then \begin {equation} \label {eq:1.1.5}
      \dot{T} = -k(T-T_m)\end {equation}<a id='x1-7r5'></a> where \(k\) is a positive constant and the minus sign
      indicates; that the temperature of the body increases with time if it’s less than the temperature of the medium, or
      decreases if it’s greater. We’ll see in Section 4.2 that if \(T_m\) is constant then the solution of (<a
        href='#x1-7r5'>1.1.5<!-- tex4ht:ref: eq:1.1.5  --></a>) is \begin {equation} \label {eq:1.1.6}
      T=T_m+(T_0-T_m)e^{-kt}\end {equation}<a id='x1-8r6'></a> where \(T_0\)
      is the temperature of the body when \(t=0\). Therefore \(\lim _{t\to \infty }T(t)=T_m\), independent of \(T_0\).

    <p class='indent'> Assuming that the medium remains at constant temperature seems reasonable if we’re considering a
      cup of
      coffee cooling in a room, but not if we’re cooling a huge cauldron of molten metal in the same room. The
      difference between the two situations is that the heat lost by the coffee isn’t likely to raise the temperature of
      the
      room appreciably, but the heat lost by the cooling metal is. In this second situation we must use a model that
      accounts for the heat exchanged between the object and the medium. Let \(T=T(t)\) and \(T_m=T_m(t)\) be the
      temperatures of the object
      and the medium respectively, and let \(T_0\) and \(T_{m0}\) be their initial values. Again, we assume that \(T\) and
      \(T_m\) are related by
      (<a href='#x1-7r5'>1.1.5<!-- tex4ht:ref: eq:1.1.5  --></a>). We also assume that the change in heat of the object as
      its temperature changes from \(T_0\) to \(T\) is \(a(T-T_0)\) and the
      change in heat of the medium as its temperature changes from \(T_{m0}\) to \(T_m\) is \(a_m(T_m-T_{m0})\), where
      \(a\) and \(a_m\) are positive constants
      depending upon the masses and thermal properties of the object and medium respectively. If we assume that
      the total heat of the in the object and the medium remains constant (that is, energy is conserved),
      then
      \[ a(T-T_0)+a_m(T_m-T_{m0})=0\]
      Solving this for \(T_m\) and substituting the result into (<a
        href='#x1-8r6'>1.1.6<!-- tex4ht:ref: eq:1.1.6  --></a>) yields the differential equation
      \[ \dot{T}=-k\left (1+{a\over a_m}\right )T +k\left (T_{m0}+{a\over a_m}T_0\right ) \]
      for the temperature of the object. After learning to solve linear first order equations, you’ll be able to show
      (Exercise 4.2. <span class='ptmb8t-'>17</span>) that



      \[ T={aT_0+a_mT_{m0}\over a+a_m}+{a_m(T_0-T_{m0})\over a+a_m}e^{-k(1+a/a_m)t}\]

    <summary>Glucose Absorption by the Body</summary>

    <p class='noindent'>Glucose is absorbed by the body at a rate proportional to the amount of glucose present in the

      when \(t=0\),
      and let \(G=G(t)\) be the number of units in the bloodstream at time \(t&gt;0\). Then, since the glucose being

    <p class='indent'> Now let’s complicate matters by injecting glucose intravenously at a constant rate of \(r\) units
      of glucose per unit
      of time. Then the rate of change of the amount of glucose in the bloodstream per unit time is \begin {equation}
      \label {eq:1.1.9} G'=-\lambda G+r\end {equation}<a id='x1-12r9'></a> where the first term
      on the right is due to the absorption of the glucose by the body and the second term is due to the injection. After
      you’ve studied Section 2.1, you’ll be able to show (Exercise 2.1. <span class='ptmb8t-'>43</span>) that the solution

      Thus,

      the object is along a vertical line. Let \(y\) be the displacement of the object from some reference point on
