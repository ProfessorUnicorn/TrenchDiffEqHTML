			IN THIS CHAPTER we study a class of second order differential equations
			that occur in many applications, but can’t be solved in closed form in
			terms of elementary functions. Here are some examples:
		</div>
		<div id="2dd688e3-6dad-4288-a48b-22dce61af093">
			(1) Bessel’s equation \[ x^2y''+xy'+(x^2-\nu ^2)y=0\] which occurs in
			problems displaying cylindrical symmetry, such as diffraction of light
			through a circular aperture, propagation of electromagnetic radiation
			through a coaxial cable, and vibrations of a circular drum head.
		</div>
		<div id="fb47eb05-d71b-4fcc-b3f5-2b70718d4c77">
			(2)
			<span class="vocab">Airy’s equation</span>
			, \[ y''-xy=0\] which occurs in astronomy and quantum physics.
		</div>
		<div id="56558ce8-5d68-4ef5-9da5-1ab0799fe37a">
			(3) Legendre’s equation \[ (1-x^2)y''-2xy'+\alpha (\alpha +1)y=0\] which
			occurs in problems displaying spherical symmetry, particularly in
			electromagnetism.
		</div>
		<div id="34869117-5b2c-48b3-8eba-f845bd0f31a0">
			These equations and others considered in this chapter can be written in
			the form \begin {equation} P_0(x)y''+P_1(x)y'+P_2(x)y=0, \tag {A} \end
			{equation}
			<a id="x1-2r1"></a>
			where \(P_0\), \(P_1\), and \(P_2\) are polynomials with no common factor.
			For most equations that occur in applications, these polynomials are of
			degree two or less. We’ll impose this restriction, although the methods
			that we’ll develop can be extended to the case where the coefficient
			functions are polynomials of arbitrary degree, or even power series that
			converge in some circle around the origin in the complex plane.
		</div>
		<div class="indent" id="b7499922-1cbd-4385-a999-8f8fb1458be9">
			Since (A) does not in general have closed form solutions, we seek series
			representations for solutions. We’ll see that if \(P_0(0)\ne 0\) then
			solutions of (A) can be written as power series \[ y=\sum _{n=0}^\infty
			a_nx^n \] that converge in an open interval centered at \(x=0\).

			are devoted to finding power series solutions of (A) in the case where
			\(P_0(0)~\ne ~0\). The situation is more complicated if \(P_0(0)=0\);
			however, if \(P_1\) and \(P_2\) satisfy assumptions that apply to most
			equations of interest, then we’re able to use a modified series method to
