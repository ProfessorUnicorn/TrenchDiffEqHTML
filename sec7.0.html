Equations</span>

</div>
<p class='noindent'>IN THIS CHAPTER we study a class of second order differential equations that occur in many
applications, but can’t be solved in closed form in terms of elementary functions. Here are some
examples:
</p><p class='noindent'>(1) Bessel’s equation
                                        \[ x^2y''+xy'+(x^2-\nu ^2)y=0\]
 which occurs in problems displaying cylindrical symmetry, such as diffraction of light through a circular
aperture, propagation of electromagnetic radiation through a coaxial cable, and vibrations of a circular drum
head.
</p><p class='noindent'>(2) <span class='vocab'>Airy’s equation</span>,
                                                                                

                                                                                
                                        \[ y''-xy=0\]
 which occurs in astronomy and quantum physics.
</p><p class='noindent'>(3) Legendre’s equation
                                        \[ (1-x^2)y''-2xy'+\alpha (\alpha +1)y=0\]
 which occurs in problems displaying spherical symmetry, particularly in electromagnetism.
</p><p class='noindent'>These equations and others considered in this chapter can be written in the form \begin {equation}  P_0(x)y''+P_1(x)y'+P_2(x)y=0, \tag {A}  \end {equation}<a id='x1-2r1'></a> where \(P_0\), \(P_1\), and \(P_2\) are polynomials
with no common factor. For most equations that occur in applications, these polynomials are of degree two or
less. We’ll impose this restriction, although the methods that we’ll develop can be extended to the case where the
coefficient functions are polynomials of arbitrary degree, or even power series that converge in some circle
around the origin in the complex plane.
</p><p class='indent'>  Since (A) does not in general have closed form solutions, we seek series representations for solutions. We’ll
see that if \(P_0(0)\ne 0\) then solutions of (A) can be written as power series
                                        \[ y=\sum _{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n \]
 that converge in an open interval centered at \(x=0\).

</p><p class='noindent'><a href="sec7.1.book.html">SECTION 7.1</a> reviews the properties of power series.
</p><p class='noindent'>SECTIONS <a href="sec7.2.book.html">7.2</a> AND <a href="sec7.3.book.html">7.3</a> are devoted to finding power series solutions of (A) in the case where \(P_0(0)~\ne ~0\). The situation is
more complicated if \(P_0(0)=0\); however, if \(P_1\) and \(P_2\) satisfy assumptions that apply to most equations of interest, then we’re
able to use a modified series method to obtain solutions of (A).
</p><p class='noindent'><a href="sec7.4.book.html">SECTION 7.4</a> introduces the appropriate assumptions on \(P_1\) and \(P_2\) in the case where \(P_0(0)=0\), and deals with <span class='vocab'>Euler’s
equation</span>
                                        \[ ax^2y''+bxy'+cy=0\]
 where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are constants. This is the simplest equation that satisfies these assumptions.
